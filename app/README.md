# App

The App uses an applet.

After building the applet in the science machine,
link the compiled applet by running in `app/public/` folder:

```bash
ln -s ../../science-machine/dist/assets/main.js applet.js
```

The `applet.js` bundle is loaded as a `script` in `index.html` 

## Available Scripts
